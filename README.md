Hospital Bed Optimization Using a Heuristic Algorithm

Overview:

This repository contains the implementation of my undergraduate thesis (TCC) project: the development of a heuristic optimization algorithm for hospital bed management.

Hospital bed allocation is a critical and complex problem faced by healthcare systems worldwide. In countries like Brazil, where public hospitals suffer from overcrowding and limited resources, improving bed management efficiency directly impacts patient safety, waiting times, and the overall quality of healthcare services.

This project models the Patient-Bed Allocation Problem (PBA) as a multi-objective integer programming problem and proposes a heuristic approach capable of providing near-optimal solutions in real-time. Unlike exact methods, which are often computationally infeasible in large hospital settings, the proposed heuristic can generate efficient and practical solutions within seconds.
